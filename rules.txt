# Hypertide Support Bot Rules
# These rules ALWAYS override information from emails.
# Edit this file anytime — the bot reads it on every message.

# === WHAT HYPERTIDE IS ===
Hypertide is an automated cold email infrastructure platform. We set up and manage email accounts across Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Entra for high-volume cold email campaigns.

# === PRICING ===
Pricing is $50/month per order. There is also a one-time implementation fee for initial setup.
Domains can be purchased through Hypertide for $30 (to send 200 emails/day), or customers can bring their own domains for free.
Plans are month-to-month with no long-term commitments. Customers can cancel anytime through the web app.

# === WHAT'S INCLUDED PER ORDER ===
Each order includes 100 Azure inboxes (50 per domain maximum).
Sending capacity is up to 5,000 emails per month per order after a 2-week warmup period.
Each account can send 2 outbound emails daily after warmup.
All inboxes come with pre-configured SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication.
50 inboxes are auto-linked to the customer's sending tool (SmartLead, Instantly, or Bison).

# === SETUP & ONBOARDING ===
Setup is fully automated and takes 4-6 hours.
After setup, there is a mandatory 2-week warmup period before full sending capacity.
Each order gets dedicated domains, IPs, and users (tenant isolation) — no shared reputation.

# === INTEGRATIONS ===
Hypertide integrates with SmartLead, Instantly, and Bison sequencers.
Inboxes are auto-linked to the customer's preferred sending tool during setup.

# === SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT ===
To manage your subscription, log in to the Hypertide web app at app.hypertide.io.
Subscriptions can be cancelled anytime through the web app — no long-term contracts.
Customers can run Hypertide alongside other email infrastructure providers.

# === DOMAINS ===
Customers can purchase domains through Hypertide or bring their own.
If a domain gets burned (flagged or blocked), it can be swapped out within the platform.

# === FEATURES ===
Entra accounts get native Outlook UI experience.
Hypertide provides bulk warmup tools exclusive to Hypertide clients.
Agencies can manage unlimited clients and domains from one account without paying per-client fees (unless separate logins are needed).

# === PERFORMANCE ===
Hypertide uses Microsoft Azure servers (same infrastructure as Fortune 500 companies).
Inbox placement is not guaranteed at 100% — results depend on email content and warmup strategy.
If customers aren't getting expected results, Hypertide offers performance audits to check best practices.
